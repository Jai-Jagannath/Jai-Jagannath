👋 Hi, I'm Sambit Prusty

I'm a 21-year-old enthusiast currently diving into the world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I'm at the very beginning of my journey, but I’m excited to learn, build, and grow in this fascinating field.

🔍 What I'm exploring right now:

The basics of AI & ML concepts

Python programming

Introductory data science tools and libraries (like NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn)

💡 Why AI/ML?
Because the idea of teaching machines to learn and solve problems is incredibly exciting! I'm curious about how things work under the hood — from simple models to more advanced algorithms.

🚀 Goals:

Build foundational knowledge in ML

Work on beginner-friendly projects

Contribute to open-source in the future

Stay consistent and keep learning!
